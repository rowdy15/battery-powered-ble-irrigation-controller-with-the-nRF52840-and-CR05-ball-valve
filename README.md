# battery-powered-ble-irrigation-controller-with-the-nRF52840-and-CR05-ball-valve
This is an update to the nRF52832 project, updating to the nRF52840 and changing from a customised propietary water timer valve to a CR05 motorized ball valve from aliexpress. NOTE, it is still very possible to use the nRF52832 with this code... I think, but I haven't tested myself.
